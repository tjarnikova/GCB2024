This folder contains scripts and outputs for the greenocean group's Global Carbon Budget submission for the year 2024.

Contents:

- `./submissionData2024`: contains data (not available on github), we are using model version RIV12
- `GCB2024_ocean_model_protocol.pdf`: protocol as received from J. Hauck
- `./scripts` contains scripts that produce output, with the batch submission file `runGCB.bsub`, that can be run using `sbatch < runGCB.bsub` 
    - Note: currently `runGCB.bsub` requires some python packages that are contained in an environment called swamp2 (notably arrow), if you are running this in the future and it's not working, check imports.
    - scripts used to make each variable are documented in SPREADSHEET (see References)
- `./notebooks` contains notebooks for visualizing outputs
- `./ModelCodeAndRunFiles` contains the archive of the model Fortran code and associated run files
